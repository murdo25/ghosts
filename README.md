all the good stuff is in main.html, the rest is just example code that helped contribute to main.html.

To do:

            
            Make the Maze: Auto maze might be easier then expected
            
            Make the Hero: duplicate ghost code? What needs to be different
            
            Make the end goals: simple fixed gifs
            
            Make the colisions for goals and ghosts: use the SetInterval.html as a resourse
            
            Powerups: speed increase, biggness, 
            
            Animations: Attack animations, hold position, moving, Angry ghost vs cute ghost

            Stretch goals
            
            Mini Server: running the game online, with start screen so many people can join together with armies of friends.
            
            Make weapons: flashlights for the hero to defend against the darkness and the ghost
            
            Fog of War: Make the hero's vision smaller, make the ghost invisable?
